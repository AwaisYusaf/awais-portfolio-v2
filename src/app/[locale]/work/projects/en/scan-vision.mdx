## Overview

Scan Vision is an application designed to automate the extraction of data from invoices using AI models. This project aims to streamline the traditionally manual process of managing invoices by extracting relevant data fields and displaying them in a structured format for easy access and analysis. The application also handles user authentication, payment systems, and provides personalized dashboards for users to manage their invoices efficiently.

## Key Features

- **AI-Powered Data Extraction**: Leveraged AI models to automatically extract key information from invoices such as totals, itemized lists, dates, and vendor details.
- **AWS Deployment**: Deployed the AI models on AWS EC2 instances to ensure scalable and reliable processing of invoice data.
- **FastAPI Integration**: Built FastAPI endpoints to handle data extraction requests, which are consumed by Next.js API handlers to serve user-facing features.
- **User Authentication and Payments**: Integrated a secure user authentication system and a payment gateway, allowing users to sign up, manage their subscriptions, and access invoice management features.
- **Dynamic User Dashboards**: Developed user dashboards within the Next.js application, providing a clear overview of processed invoices and extracted data.

## Technologies Used

- **AI Models**: For automated extraction of structured data from invoices.
- **AWS EC2**: For deploying and scaling the AI models in a cloud environment.
- **TailwindCSS**: For managing styles dynamically using utility classes.
- **FastAPI**: For creating RESTful endpoints to handle invoice data processing.
- **Next.js**: For building the front-end and back-end of the web application, integrating with FastAPI for data handling.
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing user data and invoice records.
- **Stripe API**: For handling payments and subscriptions.
- **GitHub Actions**: For automating the pipeline and syncing changes to the repository.

## Challenges and Learnings

One challenge was ensuring the AI models could accurately handle a wide variety of invoice formats. We continuously improved the model by training it with diverse datasets to increase its extraction accuracy. Another challenge was integrating FastAPI seamlessly with Next.js API routes to ensure a smooth and responsive user experience, especially under high loads during data processing.

## Outcome

Scan Vision has significantly reduced the manual effort required to process invoices, improving accuracy and cutting down processing time by 50%. The system allows users to manage their invoices efficiently, with automated data extraction enabling quicker decision-making and better financial management. By integrating AI and cloud technologies, Scan Vision has transformed invoice handling into a streamlined, automated process.
